# Image_Slide_Show
Simple image slide show on a webpage using JavaScript , HTML and CSS. 
In this html page I have used 4 images which I haven't included in my repositories, so that anyone can change the image source with their images. It has two buttons on the container of slide show by which we can change images manually.
